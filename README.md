# Bamazon-CLI

Bamazon is an Amazon-like CLI app storefront. The app takes orders from customers and updates the stocks from the store's inventory, tracks product sales across the store's departments and then provides a summary of the highest-earning departments in the store.
The app has three modes: Customer, Manager and Supervisor.

## Customer mode
Customers are able to shop in-stock items from the store/database and get total purchase cost. Input validation prevents customers from buying more items than are available.

## Manager mode.
Managers can view the entire storeâ€™s inventory (including out of stock items), view low inventory items, restock any items, and create new products to sell.

## Supervisors mode.
Supervisors can create new departments for the store and view Profit & Loss reports for each department.
